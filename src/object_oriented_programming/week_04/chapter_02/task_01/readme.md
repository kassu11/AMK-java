# Assignment 1: Using GitHub Copilot to write methods

In a new project, write a `Calculator` class that has the ability to sum positive integers. A negative integer should throw an exception.

The class acts as the model in the MVC pattern. It should have the following methods:
- A method that resets the calculator to zero.
- A method that adds an integer to the calculator.
- A method that returns the current value of the calculator.

In addition, write a temporary main method that creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and uses it to calculate the sum of a few integers.

Explore various way in which you can use GitHub Copilot to write the sum method. For example, try the following:

- Write the method signature and let GitHub Copilot write the method body.
- Write the method signature and the first line of the method body, and let GitHub Copilot write the rest. Then, modify the code to use a different loop structure (while instead of for, or vice versa) in the body.
- Write a comment where you describe the method in English, letting GitHub Copilot write the method body based on the comment.
