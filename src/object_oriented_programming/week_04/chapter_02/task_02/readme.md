# Assignment 2: Using GitHub Copilot to explain code

With GitHub Copilot, you can also write comments and explanations of code. In this assignment, you will write a textual explanation of the `Calculator` class and its methods. Use GitHub Copilot to write the explanations. Then, modify the explanations to make them more readable and understandable.

Proceed as follows:

1. Create a Markdown file in your project. Name it `README.md`. If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can read about it here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
2. Write a short description of the idea of the program in the beginning of the file. You can edit the md document in IntelliJ Idea.
3. Copy the code of the `Calculator` class to the md file. Be sure to mark the code as code by using three backticks before and after the code block:
4. Below the code, explain how the class works. Use GitHub Copilot to write the explanation. Then, modify the explanation to make it more readable and understandable.

## Documentation

How the calculator is supposed to work:
- A method that resets the calculator to zero.
- A method that adds an integer to the calculator.
- A method that returns the current value of the calculator.

```java
package object_oriented_programming.week_04.chapter_02.task_01;

// This class is a simple calculator that can add positive numbers.
// It can also reset its sum to zero.
public class Calculator {
    private int sum;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a calculator
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();

        // Test the methods
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
        calculator.add(1);
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
        calculator.add(2);
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
        calculator.add(3);
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
        calculator.add(4);
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
        calculator.add(5);
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
        calculator.reset();
        System.out.println(calculator.getSum());
    }

    // The constructor creates a new calculator with a sum of zero
    public Calculator() {
        this.sum = 0;
    }

    // This method resets the sum to zero
    public void reset() {
        this.sum = 0;
    }

    // This method adds a number to the sum
    public void add(int number) {
        // Make sure the number is positive
        if (number < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("The number must be positive.");
        }

        // Add the number to the sum
        this.sum += number;
    }

    // This method returns the sum
    public int getSum() {
        return this.sum;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- `main()` method creates a new calculator and tests the methods
- `Calculator()` constructor creates a new calculator with a sum of zero
- `reset()` method resets the sum to zero
- `add()` method adds a number to the sum
- `getSum()` method returns the sum
