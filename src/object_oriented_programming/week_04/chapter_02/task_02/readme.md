# Assignment 2: Using GitHub Copilot to explain code

With GitHub Copilot, you can also write comments and explanations of code. In this assignment, you will write a textual explanation of the `Calculator` class and its methods. Use GitHub Copilot to write the explanations. Then, modify the explanations to make them more readable and understandable.

Proceed as follows:

1. Create a Markdown file in your project. Name it `README.md`. If you are not familiar with Markdown, you can read about it here: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
2. Write a short description of the idea of the program in the beginning of the file. You can edit the md document in IntelliJ Idea.
3. Copy the code of the `Calculator` class to the md file. Be sure to mark the code as code by using three backticks before and after the code block:
4. Below the code, explain how the class works. Use GitHub Copilot to write the explanation. Then, modify the explanation to make it more readable and understandable.
