# Task 2: Vehicle Inheritance Hierarchy

Create a more complex inheritance hierarchy for vehicles by introducing abstract classes. Modify the exercise to have an abstract class `AbstractVehicle` that implements the `Vehicle` interface, and then have the `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Bus` classes extend `AbstractVehicle`. Implement additional methods and attributes in the abstract class.
