# Task 1: Sorting and Filtering using Lambda

Create a program that sorts and filters a list of objects using lambda expressions and the `Comparator` interface.

## Steps

1. **Create a Class:** Create a class called `Person` with fields `name` (String), `age` (int), and `city` (String).

2. **Create a List:** Create a list of `Person` objects with various names, ages, and cities.

3. **Sort by Age:** Use lambda expressions and the `Comparator` interface to sort the list of `Person` objects by age in ascending order.

4. **Filter by City:** Use lambda expressions to filter the sorted list and keep only the people from a specific city (e.g., "New York").

## Your Task

1. Write a Java program that follows the steps mentioned above.

2. Experiment with different lambda expressions and `Comparator` implementations to customize the sorting and filtering behavior.

3. Compile and run your program to see the output.

This exercise helps you practice using lambda expressions and the `Comparator` interface for sorting and filtering data without using the Stream API in Java.
