# Task 2: Collection Operations with Lambdas

Create a program that demonstrates basic operations on a collection of integers using lambda expressions.

## Steps

1. **Create a List:** Create a list of integers, e.g., `[10, 5, 8, 20, 15, 3, 12]`.

2. **Filter Even Numbers:** Use lambda expressions to filter out even numbers from the list.

3. **Double the Odd Numbers:** Use lambda expressions to double the value of odd numbers in the list.

4. **Sum the Numbers:** Use lambda expressions to calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.

## Your Task

1. Write a Java program that follows the steps mentioned above.

2. Experiment with different lambda expressions and operations to further understand working with collections.

3. Compile and run your program to see the output.
