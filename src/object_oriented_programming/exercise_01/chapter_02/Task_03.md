# Task 3: Obsolete measures

Leiviskä, naula and luoti are medieval Finnish units of measurement.

One leiviskä is 20 naula.
One naula is 32 luoti.
One luoti is 13.28 grams.
Write a program that asks the user for a weight in grams and converts it to medieval measurements: leiviskä, naula, and luoti. The program should work in the following way:

```
Weight (g): 30000
30 000 grams is 3 leiviskä, 10 naula, and 13.28 luoti.
```

That is, leiviskä and naula are printed as integers, and luoti is printed with two decimal places.
