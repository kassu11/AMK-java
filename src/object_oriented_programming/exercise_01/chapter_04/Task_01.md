# Task 1: A name generator

Write a program that generates random names by combining first and last names from hard-coded name arrays. The program should work as follows:

Create two arrays, firstNames and lastNames, which contain first and last names.

Ask the user how many random names the program should generate.

Generate random names using the following logic: a) Generate a random index firstNameIndex from the firstNames array. b) Generate a random index lastNameIndex from the lastNames array. c) Combine the randomly chosen first name and last name to form a new name. d) Print the generated name.

Repeat steps 3a-3d as many times as the user-specified number of names to generate.
