# Task 3: Prime number generator

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two positive integers, start and end (where start < end). The program should generate and display all the prime numbers between start and end, inclusive.

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Your program should use control structures (such as loops and conditional statements) to implement the logic for generating and checking prime numbers.
