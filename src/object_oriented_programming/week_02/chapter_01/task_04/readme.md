# Task 4: Cruise control

Add to Car class a cruise control feature. With cruise control feature, the driver can set the target speed, read the current target speed, and turn cruise control on or off. For cruise control there is a minimum and maximum speed that can be set. After target speed has been set and cruise control turned on, the car should accelerate or decelerate to reach the target speed. If reaching the target speed is not possible, cruise control must be turned off, and the driver be informed about this (perhaps the returning value of turnOn method could be used for this). Modify CarDriver class to test your cruise control. Do this before you implement cruise control in Car class. Why to modify CarDriver first?
