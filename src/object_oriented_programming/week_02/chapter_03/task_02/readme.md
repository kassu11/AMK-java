# Task 2: Book Borrowing System

Enhance the `Library` class to include a book borrowing system. Add the following methods:

- `borrowBook(String title)`: This method should simulate a book being borrowed. It should remove the book from the library's collection if available.

- `returnBook(Book book)`: This method should simulate a book being returned to the library. It should add the book back to the library's collection.
