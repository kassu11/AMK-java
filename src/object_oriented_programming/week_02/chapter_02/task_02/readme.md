# Task 2: Total Cost Calculation

Modify the `GroceryListManager` class to store both the item name and its corresponding cost as a pair (e.g., using a `HashMap<String, Double>`). Add the following methods:

- `addItem(String item, double cost)`: This method should add the given item and its cost to the grocery list.
- `calculateTotalCost()`: This method should calculate and return the total cost of all items in the grocery list.
