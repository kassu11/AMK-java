# Task 5: Shopping List

Create a separate class named `ShoppingList` that represents a list of items needed for a specific purpose (e.g., "Backyard BBQ", "Weekend Camping"). The `ShoppingList` class should have methods to add items, remove items, and display the list. Use the `ShoppingList` class within the `GroceryListManager` class to manage multiple shopping lists.
