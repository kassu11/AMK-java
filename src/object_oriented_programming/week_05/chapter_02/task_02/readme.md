# Task 2: Thread-safe

Assuming `ArrayList` is not thread-safe, design a class that has methods for adding an element to an `ArrayList` collection, querying the size of the collection, and removing an element from the collection. The elements may be any objects of your choice, such as Strings. The class you design should be thread-safe. Design a class that you can use to test thread-safety of your class.
